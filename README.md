## üéØ The Problem

In today's polarized media landscape, global events are reported with significant variations influenced by regional, political, and ideological biases. This creates disparate narratives, hides underlying agendas, and often leads to a one-sided, incomplete understanding of critical issues, fueling the spread of misinformation.

## ‚ú® Our Solution: WorldView

WorldView is a web application that leverages Artificial Intelligence to provide users with a transparent, multi-faceted view of world news. It automatically gathers articles on a single topic from diverse global sources, summarizes them, and analyzes their content for bias, allowing users to compare different narratives side-by-side on a unified, intuitive platform.

### Core Features

*   üåê **Global Article Aggregation:** Fetches news articles on any given topic from a wide range of international sources using news APIs.
*   üß† **AI-Powered Summarization:** Uses state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini to condense complex articles into concise, digestible summaries.
*   üìä **Bias Detection & Analysis:** The core of WorldView. The AI analyzes and scores articles based on:
    *   **Political Leaning:** Identifies where an article sits on the left-to-right political spectrum.
    *   **Sentiment Score:** Determines if the tone is positive, negative, or neutral.
    *   **Factual Discrepancies:** Highlights key differences in claims and data points between sources.
*   ‚ÜîÔ∏è **Intuitive Comparison UI:** Presents the analysis in a clean, visual format, making it easy to compare sources, understand their angles, and grasp the bigger picture.
